# Goose Bay Chrono Bridge

## What is this?

`@codehivetx/goosebay` is a Node.js app which takes [Time Warrior](https://timewarrior.net) export data and feeds it
into [QuickBooks Time](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/time-tracking/timesheets/) (formerly TSheets).

Not affiliated with either

### Why would I use this?

If you use Time Warrior for your time tracking, but want to send that data
over to QuickBooks Time for invoicing purposes.

### Where did the name come from?

Goose Bay, NL, Canada is very roughly somewhere between GÃ¶teborg and Mountain View.

## How does it work?

Node.js. TBD

## Setup

Set the following env vars:

- `TSHEETS_TOKEN` a TSheets access token, see [here](https://tsheetsteam.github.io/api_docs/#getting-help)
- `TSHEETS_USERID` your TSheets (numeric) user id (_how do I find this?_)
